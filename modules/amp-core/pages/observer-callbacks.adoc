== Playback related callbacks

=== onBufferingStateChanged image:callback3.jpeg[callback,70,70]

In the diagram above, at **C**, when the buffer has loaded and the player is ready for playback `onBufferingStateChanged` reports the `bufferingState` as `.ready`. If no more content is inside the buffer when it reaches **H**, which is the farthest position with a populated buffer, the `bufferingState` changes to `.delayed`. In the event of an error the `bufferingState` is set to `.unknown`. In summary:

* `.ready` when the buffer is ready and playback can start
* `.delayed` when the buffer is not full (player is still loading content)
* `.unknown` when loading has not started or there has been an error

The following code is an alternative for enabling autoplay by instructing AMP to start playback as soon as the buffer is ready.
[source,swift]
----
func onBufferingStateChanged(_ ampPlayer: AmpPlayer) {
    if ampPlayer.bufferingState == .ready {
        ampPlayer.play()
    }
}
----

=== onPlaybackStateChanged image:callback3.jpeg[callback,70,70]

`onPlaybackStateChanged` is called when the playback state changes. There are five states.

* `.playing` when the content is being played.
* `.paused` when content is paused.
* `.stopped` when playback is stopped.
* `.ended` when playback has ended by reaching the end of the stream
* `.failed` when playback failed to start or there has been an error

In the diagram above the `playbackState` since playback started at **C** is `.playing`. Tapping the pause button will change it to `.paused`. Terminating playback will set it to `stopped` and if normal playback is allowed until the end at **I** the state changes at this point to `ended`. If there had been an error, the status would have been changed to `failed`.

The following code will enable an infinite loop, by replaying content once playback has reached the end of the video.

[source,swift]
----
func onPlaybackStateChanged(_ ampPlayer: AmpPlayer) {
    if ampPlayer.playbackState == .ended {
        ampPlayer.replay()
    }
}
----

=== onBitrateChanged image:callback3.jpeg[callback,70,70]

`onBitrateChanged` alerts when there is a bitrate change

[source,swift]
----
func onBitrateChanged(_ ampPlayer: AmpPlayer, bitrate: Double) {
    print ("Bitrate changed, new bitrate is \(bitrate)")
}
----

=== onPositionChanged image:callback3.jpeg[callback,70,70]

In the diagram above, **B** is the visual representation of the timeline. As the scrubber moves along the timeline it updates its position and is reported by `onPositionChanged`.

[source,swift]
----
func onPositionChange(_ ampPlayer: AmpPlayer) {
    print ("Position changed to \(ampPlayer.currentStreamTime)")
}
----

=== onTimeChanged image:callback3.jpeg[callback,70,70]

In the diagram above, **A** indicates the current playback time, changes in playback time are reported by `onTimeChanged`.

[source,swift]
----
func onTimeChange(_ ampPlayer: AmpPlayer) {
    print ("Time changed to \(ampPlayer.currentStreamTime)")
}
----

== Ad related callbacks

In the diagram above, the ad break starts at **D** and ends at **G**. Inside the break, an ad starts at **D** and ends at **E**, and another one starts at **F** and ends at **G**. AMP uses callbacks that signal the start and end of ads and ad breaks.

=== onAdStarted image:callback3.jpeg[callback,70,70]

`onAdStarted` is called when ad starts in an ad pod

[source,swift]
----
func onAdStarted(ad: AdInfo?) {
    print("Reporting the start of ad \(ad!.position)")
}
----

=== onAdEnded image:callback3.jpeg[callback,70,70]

`onAdEnded` is called when ad ends in an ad pod

[source,swift]
----
func onAdEnded(ad: AdInfo?) {
    print("Reporting the end of ad \(ad!.position)")
}
----

=== onAdBreakStarted image:callback3.jpeg[callback,70,70]

`onAdBreakStarted` is called when an ad pod break starts

[source,swift]
----
onAdBreakStarted(break: AdBreakInfo?) {
    print("Reporting onAdBreakStarted")
}
----

=== onAdBreakEnded image:callback3.jpeg[callback,70,70]

`onAdBreakEnded` is called when an ad pod break ends

[source,swift]
----
func onAdBreakEnded(break: AdBreakInfo?) {
    print("Reporting onAdBreakEnded")
}
----

=== onAdResumed image:callback3.jpeg[callback,70,70]

`onAdResumed` is called when an ad resumes after being paused

[source,swift]
----
func onAdResumed(ad: AdInfo?) {
    print("Reporting the resuming of ad \(ad!.position)")
}
----

=== onAdPaused image:callback3.jpeg[callback,70,70]

`onAdPaused` is called when an ad is paused

[source,swift]
----
func onAdPaused(ad: AdInfo?) {
    print("Reporting the pause of ad \(ad!.position)")
}
----

=== onAdSkipped image:callback3.jpeg[callback,70,70]

`onAdSkipped` is called when an ad is skipped. This applies for skippable ads.

[source,swift]
----
func onAdSkipped() {
    print("Reporting the skipping of ad \(ad!.position)")
}
----

== Error Handling

=== onAmpError image:callback3.jpeg[callback,70,70]

For handling and reported AMP related errors, the information can be retrieved from the `onAmpError` callback

[source,swift]
----
func onAmpError(_ ampPlayer: AmpPlayer, error: PlayerError, code: Int, message: String) {
    print ("AMP has reported an error: Code \(code), \(error.description)")
}
----
